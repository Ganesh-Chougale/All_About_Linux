Both `man` and `pinfo` are used to view documentation in Linux, but they have some key differences. Here's a comparison:

| Feature | `man` | `pinfo` |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Displays manual pages (man pages) for commands | Displays info pages, often used for GNU utilities |
| **Navigation** | Uses `less` (basic navigation with arrow keys, `/` for search, `q` to quit) | Uses a text-based interface with hyperlinks (similar to a web browser) |
| **Hierarchy** | Man pages are single documents with sections | Info pages are structured hierarchically with multiple nodes |
| **Search** | Supports `/` for searching within a page | Supports searching across sections with links |
| **Formatting** | Simple text formatting | More structured and colorful formatting |
| **Usage** | `man <command>` | `pinfo <command>` |
| **Readability** | Plain text, may be harder to read for complex documentation | Easier to navigate with hyperlinks and structured sections |
| **Default Availability** | Pre-installed on most Linux distributions | May need to be installed separately (`sudo apt install pinfo` on Debian/Ubuntu) |

### When to Use:
- Use `man` for quick reference and basic documentation.
- Use `pinfo` for detailed GNU documentation, especially for complex commands like `gcc` or `bash`.
