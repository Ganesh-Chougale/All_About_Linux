The `/etc` directory is crucial in Linux as it contains system-wide configuration files. Below are some important files and directories inside `/etc` that every Linux learner should know:

### **User & Group Management**
- `/etc/passwd` → Stores user account information (username, UID, GID, home directory, shell).
- `/etc/shadow` → Stores encrypted user passwords and password policies (only root can read).
- `/etc/group` → Stores group information (group name, GID, members).
- `/etc/gshadow` → Stores secure group passwords (only root can read).

### **System & Network Configuration**
- `/etc/hostname` → Stores the system's hostname.
- `/etc/hosts` → Maps hostnames to IP addresses (like a mini-DNS).
