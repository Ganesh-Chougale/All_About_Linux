- **Terminal** is a UI that provides access to the shell. It's just a window where you type commands.  
- **CLI (Command Line Interface)** is the way you interact with the shell via text commands—it’s the communication layer.  
- **Shell** is both an interpreter and a scripting language that processes commands.  

Another way to visualize it:  

📟 **Terminal** = Screen where you type  
🔗 **CLI** = Middleman handling input/output  
⚙️ **Shell** = Brain that interprets and executes  

Your final flow is spot on:  
`Terminal (UI) ↔ CLI (Mediator) ↔ Shell (Computation)`

or to check shell versions
